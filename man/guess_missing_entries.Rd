\usage{
guess_missing_entries(id, values)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{identifier vector}

\item{values}{corresponding values with potentially missing information (NAs)}
}
\value{
A vector with augmented values
}
\description{
Fill in missing values. This function assumes that
entries of the id but available in others. The missing data will be
filled based on the available values. Ambiguous cases (same id but
multiple values) are ignored.
}
\details{
For instance, we may have authors and author life
years (birth and death). The life years may be available for
a given author in some entries and missing in others.
When the information is unique, this function fills the missing
entries where possible. The function checks that the available
life years for the given id (author in this example) are unique
(ie. to avoid ambiguous mappings, for instance distinct authors
with identical name but different birth year). For unique id-value
relation, use the unique value to fill in the missing entries for
the same id)
